Assignment: Assignment 3 - Self Balancing Tree

Overview: 

- In this assighment I implemented both a AVL tree and Binaray tree 

Path to the Finish line: 

- I faced many issues during this program one of which was inestionally
  implementing the AVL insert iterativly which didn't go well which is why
  I resorted to implementing the insert in a AVL as a Recursive method.

Compiled With: 

g++ -g -O0 TreeDriver.cpp -o treetest
valgrind --leak-check=yes ./treetest
./treetest 

Note: The code runs, there are no segmentation faults or memory leaks
